**The latest node.js version using which informixdb is tested: 14.9.0**

## Prerequisite

- Python 2.7 is required by node-gyp.

- Informix CSDK (Client Software Development Kit) for connectivity.

- If Windows Platform : for compilation of informixdb Visual Studio is required, if not available then module will install with "pre-compiled" binary version.

- If Linux Platform : for compilation of informixdb C++11 compiler is required, if not available then module will install with "pre-compiled" binary version.
  (Note the default compiler on RHEL 6 does not have the required support. Install a newer compiler or upgrade the older one.)

## Install

You may install the package using npm install command:

```
npm install informixdb
```

or, you can install the latest driver from Github (Not recommanded for production use):

```
npm install git+https://github.com/OpenInformix/node-informixdb.git
```

> [For more installation details please refer:  INSTALLATION GUIDE](https://github.com/OpenInformix/node-informixdb/blob/master/INSTALL.md)

## API Documentation

> [For complete list of informixdb APIs and example, please check API DOCUMENTATION](https://github.com/OpenInformix/node-informixdb/blob/master/APIDocumentation.md)


### Important Environment Variables and Download Essentials 

`CSDK_HOME :`

- USE:
	- On distributed platforms, set this environment variable if you want to compile/build the informixdb module.

- HOW:
	- Set **CSDK_HOME** environment variable to a pre-installed **Informix CSDK or Informix server installation directory**.

`INFORMIXDIR :`

- USE:
	- On distributed platforms, set this environment variable if you want to compile/build the informixdb module.

- HOW:
	- Set **INFORMIXDIR** environment variable to a pre-installed **Informix server installation directory**.



## Quick Example

```javascript
var informix = require('informixdb');

informix.open("SERVER=dbServerName;DATABASE=dbName;HOST=hostName;SERVICE=port;UID=userID;PWD=password;", function (err,conn) {
  if (err) return console.log(err);
  
  conn.query('select 1 from table(set{1})', function (err, data) {
    if (err) console.log(err);
    else console.log(data);

    conn.close(function () {
      console.log('done');
    });
  });
});
```

## How to get an informixdb instance?

The simple api is based on the instances of `Database` class. You may get an 
instance by one of the following ways:

```javascript
require("informixdb").open(connectionString, function (err, conn){
  //conn is already open now if err is falsy
});
```

or by using the helper function:

```javascript
var informix = require("informixdb")();
``` 

or by creating an instance with the constructor function:

```javascript
var Database = require("informixdb").Database
  , informix = new Database();
```

## Debug

If you would like to enable debugging messages to be displayed you can add the 
flag `DEBUG` to the defines section of the `binding.gyp` file and then execute 
`node-gyp rebuild`.

```javascript
<snip>
'defines' : [
  "DEBUG"
],
<snip>
```

## Un-Install

To uninstall informixdb from your system, just delete the node-informixdb or informixdb directory.


## For AIX install issue

If `npm install informixdb` aborts with "Out Of Memory" error on AIX, first run `ulimit -d unlimited` and then `npm install informixdb`.
